# getBinaryStrings-n-
 This code defines a function getBinaryStrings(n) that generates all possible binary strings of length n. It works recursively by generating smaller strings for n-1 and prepending 0 or 1 to form all combinations of binary strings for the current length. The function returns a list of binary strings, and an example usage is provided for n=2.
